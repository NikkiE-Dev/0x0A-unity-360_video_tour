### Welcome to my story

I can introduce myself as a programmer and a game developer. I had a passion for programming and I was hooked. I came into this thinking I knew quite 
a bit when it came to programming. I found out early on that the knowledge I came in with was just tip of the iceberg.  I was always looking for ways 
to improve my skills and I was always looking for ways to learn new things. I have always played video games but looked at it as a hobby. Never did I 
imagined myself as a actual game developer. Now I get to make my hobby a career and with it enter a new world of programming.

### The Project
This project is a Unity project that I created to learn how to use the Unity 360 video tour. It focuses on the Unity 360 video tour and how to use it.
As a I was workign this project it originally called to have each room in a seperate sphere. However I found a more efficient way to do this.By adding 
the videos as a Skybox I was able to use the video as a background. From there it was easy to navagate through the videos with an onclick event. 
Music was added to the videos to make it more immersive.

### Features that still need to be implemented
I have not implemented a transition to the next video yet. The video does change but it is not smooth.
